Brain rot is watching mindless entertainment and possibly lose some brain cells afterward. I feel like brain rot has a negative impact because there are more cases of ADHD than in the last couple years. Slop is basically a low quality video that I sometimes watch. Lore is a hidden story inside a game like Five Nights at Freddy. It is impossible to avoid brain rot if you watch TikTok.

I remember when the government intervene on Youtube, it made it where people had to say if their video is for kids or adults. But, if they say the video is for adults but your video is family friendly, then you can get fined $50,000+. How a company like TikTok can address security concerns is by monitoring videos as soon as it comes out. And make it where the app is not listening to you. One thing I want to do as a TikTok developer is to make it where you can't upload fake AI of someone who actually committed suicide. The main lesson I learned is to program a thing to ban someone who made a 18+ video.

The most interesting thing that I learned was that my phone ran out of storage. The reason it ran out of storage was because a game I had was about  17.7 GB. And my phone only had about 22 GB. So, I can buy more storage or a new phone(which I want).

Technology can help teachers understand slang by watching some Gen-Z influencers. For example, I suggest the older generations to watch Kai Cenat and Duke Dennis. They might be traumatize, but it can help them learn the slangs easier. Integrating slang translation tools into educational apps, AI chatbots, or online resources could offer benefits like improved language comprehension for learners, especially in informal settings, and increased engagement by allowing them to understand colloquial language, but also presents challenges including potential inaccuracies in translation, cultural misunderstandings, and the risk of promoting inappropriate language use depending on the slang context and implementation methods. I suggest that schools shouldn't use some slangs and we can just talk normally. Ways in which K-12 teachers think using slang in an academic setting affects students' language development: It can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications (54%). It may disrupt the learning environment (50%). It diminishes formal writing skills (41%).

Students sitting for their STAAR exams this week will be part of a new method of evaluating Texas schools: Their written answers on the state’s standardized tests will be graded automatically by computers.

The Texas Education Agency is rolling out an “automated scoring engine” for open-ended questions on the State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness for reading, writing, science and social studies. The technology, which uses natural language processing, a building block of artificial intelligence chatbots such as GPT-4, will save the state agency about $15 million to 20 million per year that it would otherwise have spent on hiring human scorers through a third-party contractor.

The change comes after the STAAR test, which measures students’ understanding of state-mandated core curriculum, was redesigned in 2023. The test now includes fewer multiple choice questions and more open-ended questions — known as constructed response items. After the redesign, there are six to seven times more constructed response items.

“We wanted to keep as many constructed open ended responses as we can, but they take an incredible amount of time to score,” said Jose Rios, director of student assessment at the Texas Education Agency.

I feel like banning cell phones from schools can be detrimental to students. For example, during a emergency you'll have to call your parents about the situation. Banning cell phones might make students more productive in class. But, not banning cell phones can help students if they don't have their chromebook. I will be fine with the restrictions because I don't bring my phone to school. The other kids will start having a panic attack if they don't have their phones for 5 seconds.
